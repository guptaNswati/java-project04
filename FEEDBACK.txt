FEEDBACK:

Good implementation of queue data structure, especially in using 
    object oriented design to extend your generic LinkedList class.


Good testing of your implementation. You're very close.
  Make sure to check for boundary cases.


-0 class Queue is missing required field "name" as required by project description.
   Set the argument of the constructor to the name of the queue. 
   Otherwise, it is difficult to identify the stack you are displaying.
   See sample output in project description.

   Next time minus for this.


-3 incomplete implementation of class Queue dequeue() method does not successfully
   handle when a playlist is empty.
   See sample output below.


-0 Missing documentation for your Queue class, etc in Javadocs.
	I see that you commented your source code. 
	Perhaps you forgot to indicate which files to generate Javadocs
	when selecting from Eclipse menu "Project" -> "Generate Javadocs" ?
    
    Did you forget to verify whether your index.html file in "doc" folder generated correctly? 

    Next time minus  for this.

-Bita.
